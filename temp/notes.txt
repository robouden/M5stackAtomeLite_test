    Add storage in EEprom for Frequency, rough frequency fine and dutycycle 
    At startup check if default storage populated if populated ignore the readings of the potmeter
    Recall storage data in memory

    If button is pressed switched to new case and set LED color for functionality
        red     = frequency rough frequency
        green   = frequency field_names
        blue    = dutycycle.
    
    If button is long pushed, save current data in the current storage for the reading in the EEPROM
